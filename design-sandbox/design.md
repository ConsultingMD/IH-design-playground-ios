# Included Health — DESIGN.md

# Overview

Included Health is an **AI‑first, human‑supported front door to high‑quality clinical care**, helping members understand what’s going on and what to do next with clear, safe guidance. Experiences should feel **warm, trustworthy, and clinically grounded**—combining expert care standards with consumer‑grade clarity and polish—never gimmicky, generic, or “bot‑ish.” We design for **emotional safety and medical accuracy first**, then efficiency and convenience.

# Principles

### Design with Care

### Human. Always.

Design with empathy, clarity, and care — especially in moments that matter most.

Our experiences are grounded in human needs, not system constraints. We design for emotional safety, comprehension, and trust across every ability, context, and state of mind. When things go wrong, the system responds with calm, kindness, and clear paths forward.

*Rules the agent should follow*

* Reduce cognitive and emotional burden: Prefer one primary action per screen, clear hierarchy, and short, plain-language copy over dense walls of text.  
* Design for emotional safety: Avoid surprise states or dead ends; always show what’s happening, what’s expected of the member, and what happens next.  
* Ground in human needs, not system constraints: If a layout or flow choice conflicts, bias toward member comprehension, safety, and trust over backend convenience.  
* Fail calmly: In error or edge states, use calm tone, clear explanations, and a safe next step instead of blame, technical jargon, or abrupt stops.

### Clear by design

Make the right thing obvious through hierarchy, structure, and intent.

Clarity is not neutral; it’s designed. We use hierarchy, motion, and constraint to guide attention and decision-making. Every element earns its place, and nothing competes without purpose.

*Rules the agent should follow*

* One clear primary action: On each surface, visually emphasize a single primary CTA; demote or convert other actions to secondary/tertiary patterns.  
* Use hierarchy, not decoration: Use typographic scale, spacing, and color prominence to guide attention; avoid adding icons or color solely for decoration.  
* Constrain to clarify: Prefer progressive disclosure (expanders, separate steps, details-on-demand) over dense single screens.  
* Every element must earn its place: Remove or demote UI that doesn’t support a clear member job; avoid competing focal points on the same surface.

### Confident, not rigid

Design systems should adapt, evolve, and lead — not constrain creativity.

Our system sets strong foundations while allowing flexibility where it matters. We favor principles and patterns over prescriptions, enabling teams to respond to new contexts, technologies, and member needs with confidence.

*Rules the agent should follow*

* Start from system patterns: Use existing components and tokens first (buttons, cards, chips, messaging patterns) before inventing anything new.  
* Extend, don’t fork: When something new is required, extend semantic tokens or patterns (for example, new semantic color or chip variant) instead of one-off styling.  
* Adapt to context safely: It’s acceptable to adjust layout, density, or component combinations as long as core affordances, semantics, and accessibility rules stay intact.  
* Prefer reversible decisions: When choosing between patterns, prefer those that are easy to adjust or generalize later over highly bespoke layouts that will be hard to maintain.

### Guidance

### Three-tiered structure

Our color system is structured into three tiers.

1. **Core tokens**  
     
   - Core tokens form the atoms of the palette, covering every possible tint and tone from the brand palette.  
   - Core colors are never used directly in design or implementation.  
   - Core tokens are intentionally not published directly from the IH Library so they are not used in design mockups.  
   - When a new use case arises where existing semantic tokens are not sufficient, create a new semantic token.

   

2. **Semantic tokens**  
     
   - Semantic tokens are the colors used in the product.  
   - They are identified by meaning, such as `brand` or `success`, to indicate where and how they should be used and their prominence on screen.  
   - Every semantic token references a core token.  
   - Separating atoms from meaning supports future theming and modes.

   

3. **Component tokens**  
     
   - Component tokens are reserved for exceptional or intentionally deviant use cases.  
   - They should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.  
   - There are currently no standard component tokens.

### Demonstration examples

Example progression across the system:

- Core token: `blue/300`  
- Semantic token: `surface/brand/base`  
- Component token: `component/progress-bar/completion/color/surface`

`component/progress-bar/completion/color/surface` is a demonstration only and is not an actual published token.

### Semantic categories

- `surface`  
- `text`  
- `border`

### Prominence model

- `weakest`  
- `weak`  
- `base`  
- `strong`  
- `strongest`

### Dark mode

### Dark mode is architecturally supported but not yet published in this DESIGN.md. Do not generate new dark-mode variants or tokens (for example, surface/\*/on-dark) beyond what is explicitly documented here. Treat this spec as light-theme only until a dedicated dark-mode palette is added.

### Accessible color combinations

When choosing color combinations, maintain at least:

- 4.5:1 contrast ratio for body text and smaller.  
- 3:1 contrast ratio for large text (≥ 18pt regular or 14pt bold).  
- 3:1 contrast ratio for non-text UI elements (icons, borders, focus rings).

For clinical content and high-stakes flows, aim for AAA where practical (7:1 for body, 4.5:1 for large text).

Vetted pairings (examples):

- surface/neutral/weakest or surface/neutral/base + text/primary/dark  
- surface/neutral/strong or surface/neutral/strongest \+ text/primary/light  
- surface/brand/base \+ text/primary/light  
- surface/success/base \+ text/primary/light  
- surface/warning/base \+ text/primary/light  
- surface/danger/base \+ text/primary/light  
- surface/overlay/base \+ text/primary/light for modal headings and body

Rules:

- Do not invent ad-hoc pairs; always choose from the semantic surface/text tokens.  
- Never use text/\*/weak tokens on light neutral surfaces; reserve them for dark brand or status surfaces as documented above.  
- All final combinations must meet or exceed the ratios above.

## Usage rules 

- Never use raw hex values in product UI decisions when a semantic token exists.  
- Never reference core palette tokens directly in product UI.  
- Use semantic tokens for all product decisions.  
- Use component tokens only when a semantic token cannot express the intended use.  
- All final combinations must meet WCAG AA contrast or better.

| `0` | `0` | `0px` |
| `2x-small` | `0.25rem` | `4px` |
| `x-small` | `0.5rem` | `8px` |
| `small` | `0.75rem` | `12px` |
| `medium` | `1rem` | `16px` |
| `large` | `1.5rem` | `24px` |
| `x-large` | `2rem` | `32px` |
| `2x-large` | `3rem` | `48px` |
| `3x-large` | `4rem` | `64px` |

### Usage guidelines

#### Base unit

The base unit (`1rem = 16px`) should be used as the starting point for most spacing decisions. Adjust up or down the scale depending on the specific need and context.

#### Small values (`0px` to `8px`)

Use within smaller components and compact pieces of the user interface.

Examples:

- gap between button groups  
- padding within input components  
- vertical spacing between elements in a card or list item

#### Medium values (`12px` to `24px`)

Use for larger components and non-compact pieces of the user interface.

Examples:

- padding within cards  
- spacing between icons and text in cards  
- space between sections of content on small screens

#### Large values (`32px` to `64px`)

Use for layout only.

Examples:

- spacing between sections on large screens

### Responsive design

Consider how spacing might need to adjust across screen sizes.

In many cases, smaller spaces are appropriate for mobile views, while larger spaces can be used in desktop layouts.

### Breakpoints

For responsive behavior, use these canonical breakpoints:

sm: 640px  
md: 768px  
lg: 1024px  
xl: 1280px

Use smaller spacing values on sm views (mobile), and allow more generous spacing on lg/xl where layout permits.

### Customization & deduplication 

While the predefined scale should cover most needs, occasional exceptions may be necessary. When deviating from the scale, ensure that changes are justified and documented.

Treat the main spacing scale table (with rem and pixel values) as the single source of truth. Do not maintain a separate “token values in pixels” table; if one exists, remove it or ensure it simply references the primary table above.

## Elevation

### Figma (Elevation \- Foundations)

https://www.figma.com/design/VT79VSlhYlpl0g2JS9vLKt/Anatomy--IH-Design-System?node-id=2508-97995&p=f&t=wsnXwl8rOJXa2DXu-0

### Guidance

Elevation uses subtle drop shadows to communicate hierarchy, separation, and scroll state. The system defines three levels: No Elevation, Elevation 1, and Elevation 2\.

In general, use No Elevation for flatter, more integrated surfaces, Elevation 1 for standard card-based components, and Elevation 2 sparingly for UI that needs stronger separation when it becomes sticky or overlays scrolling content.

| Level | Token | Box-shadow | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `No Elevation` | `elevation/none` | `none` | Flat surfaces that should feel embedded in the page (tables, simple cards, inline tiles). |
| `Elevation 1` | `elevation/1.0` | `2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` | Default cards and containers that need light separation from the background. |
| `Elevation 2` | `elevation/2.9` | `6px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.16)` | Sticky headers, floating toolbars, and overlays that must clearly sit above scrolling content. |

### Usage

#### No Elevation

- Use for new homepage cards and tiles.  
- Use for tables.  
- Best when the surface should feel lightweight and embedded in the layout.

#### Elevation 1

- Use for existing cards and tiles.  
- Best for default container surfaces that need light separation from the background.

#### Elevation 2

- Use for tabs or headers when content underneath is scrolled.  
- Best for sticky UI that needs to feel anchored above the content layer.

### Guidance

Use elevation intentionally, not decoratively.

Default to the lowest level that preserves clarity, and increase elevation only when it helps communicate hierarchy, persistence, or scroll behavior.

Rules:

Use the lowest elevation that preserves clarity.  
Do not stack multiple shadow values; use the named tokens above.  
Do not introduce new custom box-shadow values in product UI.

## Icons

### Figma (Icons \- Foundations) 

https://www.figma.com/design/VT79VSlhYlpl0g2JS9vLKt/Anatomy--IH-Design-System?node-id=2069-97841&p=f&t=NTm7uNidWw2XAsH0-0

Icons provide quick, scannable cues for meaning and status. They should clarify actions and information, not decorate or add noise. Use icons consistently across platforms so they feel like a single, coherent set.

### Library and sources

- Use icons from the **Included Health icon library**, which is built primarily from **Streamline Regular** and **Streamline Bold** sets.  
- Do not introduce new icon styles or one‑off illustrations without coordination with the Design System team.  
- If you need an icon that isn’t in the library:  
  - First, check the Streamline Regular/Bold sets to see if an existing icon fits the use case.  
  - If a match exists, contact the Design System team to have it added to the library.  
  - If not, work with the Design System team to find, create, or approve a new icon.

### Styles: Regular vs Bold

- The library provides icons in at least two weights: **Regular** and **Bold**.  
- Use **Bold** for small sizes (anything smaller than 16px). Regular strokes are too thin to read well at that scale.  
- Use Regular or Bold **consistently within a UI region**; do not mix weights arbitrarily.  
- A Bold icon is not just a filled version of Regular; it often has different strokes and shapes.  
  - Do **not** use Bold as a hover state for a Regular icon—rapidly toggling between the two can look awkward.  
  - For hover or active states, prefer **color changes, background treatments, or subtle motion** instead of switching between Regular and Bold.

### Sizes

Standard icon sizes:

- **12px** – use **Bold only** (Regular is too thin at this size).  
- **16px**  
- **20px**  
- **24px**  
- **32px**

Usage notes:

- Use the smallest size that remains legible and balanced with surrounding text and components.  
- For icons used inside circular or pill‑shaped containers (for example, grey icon circles), use **24px Regular** inside the container for best balance.  
- Ensure icons are centered within their hit area and aligned with the layout grid so they don’t appear visually off‑center.

| Token | Size | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `icon/size/xs` | `12px` | Very small indicators; use Bold only. |
| `icon/size/sm` | `16px` | Default icon size for most controls. |
| `icon/size/md` | `20px` | Icons paired with larger text or in dense cards. |
| `icon/size/lg` | `24px` | Hero icons, circular icon containers. |
| `icon/size/xl` | `32px` | Larger illustrative moments in cards or tiles. |

### Color and accessibility

- Icon colors must follow the **semantic color tokens**:  
  - Default/actionable icons: `text/primary dark` or `text/brand/*`.  
  - Disabled icons: `text/disabled`.  
  - Status icons: `text/success/*`, `text/warning/*`, or `text/danger/*` where they represent status.  
- Maintain sufficient **contrast** between icons and background to meet accessibility standards, especially for critical or status icons.  
- Avoid using **color alone** to signal meaning in high‑stakes contexts; pair status icons with labels or helper text where appropriate.

### Usage guidelines

- Use icons **only where they add clarity**—reinforcing an action, indicating status, or improving scannability in dense lists.  
- Avoid purely decorative icons that do not change comprehension or behavior.  
- Pair icons with **clear labels** in most cases; icons alone should be reserved for universally recognizable actions (for example, a standard close “X”).  
- Keep icon metaphors consistent across the product.

### Accessibility

- Provide accessible names/labels for icons that identify **what they do or represent**.  
- Do not rely on icon shape alone to convey critical information; ensure that labels or text equivalents exist.

## Avatars

### Figma (Avatars \- Components) (https://www.figma.com/design/VT79VSlhYlpl0g2JS9vLKt/Anatomy--IH-Design-System?node-id=36593-12584&t=wsnXwl8rOJXa2DXu-0)

### Guidance

Avatars visually represent people, locations, or Dot in the product. They provide a quick anchor for identity and context (who this is about, where care is happening, or when Dot is speaking) and should always feel clear, respectful, and consistent.

See Figma instance table for px

#### What avatars can represent

- **People** – members, care team, providers, support.  
- **Locations** – clinics, facilities, or geographic anchors.  
- **Dot** – the Included Health AI assistant.  
- **Badges** – optional overlays (for example, BH) that convey specialization or role.

#### Avatar elements

Each avatar can display some combination of:

- **Photo (conditional)**  
  - Preferred when we have an approved, up‑to‑date photo.  
  - Cropped and framed consistently according to brand guidance.  
- **Initials (conditional)**  
  - Used when no photo is available.  
  - Default to first \+ last initials from the person’s name.  
- **Location pin (conditional)**  
  - Used when the primary meaning is a place.  
- **Dot (conditional)**  
  - Used when the entity speaking/acting is Dot (AI), not a human.  
- **BH badge or similar (conditional)**  
  - Used to represent behavioral health or other key specialties when appropriate.

Do not mix multiple, competing meanings in a single avatar (for example, both Dot and a person photo). Choose the element that best matches the context.

#### Sizes and usage

- Use standard avatar sizes (small, medium, large) and keep them consistent within a surface.  
- In dense tables or lists, use smaller avatars; in hero/profile contexts, use larger avatars.  
- Ensure avatars align to the grid and text baselines.

#### Interaction

- Avatars are **non‑interactive** by default.  
- When avatars appear inside an interactive component, the **parent component** owns the tap/click behavior, not the avatar.

#### Content and privacy

- Use only approved and appropriate photos; never use joke images or unrelated artwork.  
- When a real person’s photo is not available or appropriate, use initials or a generic placeholder that still fits the system.  
- Respect member privacy and clinical context when deciding whether to show photos.

#### Accessibility

- Provide accessible names/labels that identify **who or what** the avatar represents.  
- Do not rely on the avatar alone to convey critical information; pair with text labels.

## Badges

### Figma (Badges \- Components)

https://www.figma.com/design/VT79VSlhYlpl0g2JS9vLKt/Anatomy--IH-Design-System?node-id=35928-17750

### Guidance

Badges are small visual indicators used to highlight information, typically a number counter, a short word, an icon, or a simple dot. They draw attention to new, unread, or important content without overwhelming the interface.

#### When to use

Use badges to:

- Indicate **unread or new items**.  
- Show **notification counts**.  
- Display a single, important **status** (for example, online/offline, verified).  
- Highlight **new features or content**.

Badges are **never interactive/clickable**. Any tap/click behavior belongs to the parent element (for example, tab, list item, card).

#### Anatomy

A badge can contain:

1. **Container (badge)**  
     
   - Small pill or circular shape.  
   - Size proportional to the element it’s associated with.

   

2. **Label or Icon**  
     
   - Center‑aligned content.  
   - Can be:  
     - Number (for example, `1`, `12`, `99+`),  
     - Short text (for example, `New`, `Delayed`),  
     - Icon, or  
     - Dot (no label).

   

3. **Outline (optional)**  
     
   - Width: **2px**.  
   - Color: matches the parent background (usually `bg/primary`).  
   - Used when the badge sits on top of another element.

#### Types, sizes, and variants

Badges come in two sizes (`small`, `medium`) and three main content types (`number`, `icon`, `text`), each with `primary` and `secondary` variants across `danger`, `warning`, `success`, `brand`, and `neutral` styles, plus a `dot` type in small only.

**Number badges**

- Minimum size about **20×20px**.  
- Text style: **Caption – Bold**.  
- Horizontal padding: small (about `2x-small` / 4px).  
- Expand horizontally for 2–3 digits.

**Text badges**

- For short words like “New” or “Delayed”.  
- Heights:  
  - Small: **20px**.  
  - Medium: **24px**.  
- Horizontal padding around **8px** (`x-small`).  
- Small: Caption – Bold; Medium: Body 2\.

**Icon badges**

- Small: icon 10px, container 20×20px.  
- Medium: icon 12px, container 24×24px.  
- Used when an icon alone can clearly convey meaning.

**Dot badges**

- Dot only, size \~8×8px.  
- Used as a subtle indicator when number/label is unnecessary.

For accessibility at high zoom, badges should scale with the UI; exception is when attached to images that do not scale (for example, static avatars).

#### Placement

- Typically on or near the **top‑right corner** of the associated icon/element.  
- Can sit between text and controls inside components when that better fits the layout.  
- Keep badges close enough to clearly associate them with their target.

#### Color and style

Use semantic colors aligned with meaning:

- **Danger (red)** – default notification and error.  
- **Warning (yellow)** – warnings/caution.  
- **Success (green)** – positive/online (future use).  
- **Brand** – brand‑specific emphasis (future use).  
- **Neutral (grey)** – offline/low‑emphasis (future use).

Badges should be small and unobtrusive but high enough contrast to be visible.

#### Behavior

- Badges are not interactive.  
- Notification badges should clear or hide once associated content is viewed or acknowledged.

##### Dot animation (optional, Dot variant)

- Small animated dot for high‑value notifications.  
- Appears by “bouncing” into place:  
  - Fades in small,  
  - Grows slightly past final size,  
  - Settles at final size.  
- Typical use: on **Bottom Tab Bar** when Home loads with notifications or new notification arrives.

#### Properties (summary)

- `type`: `dot` (default), `number`, `text`, `icon`  
- `style`: `danger` (default), `warning`, `success`, `brand`, `neutral`  
- `hierarchy`: `primary` (default), `secondary`  
- `size`: `small` (default), `medium` (no medium for `dot`)  
- `isAnimated` (dot only): `false` (default), `true`  
- `outline`: `none` (default), `white` (for gray/dense backgrounds)  
- `roundedCorners`: `all` (default), `partial` (when flush to an edge)

#### Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast.  
- Provide accessible names or additional context (for example, “3 unread messages”).  
- Do not use badges as the sole location of critical information.

## Footer

### Figma (Footer \- Components)

https://www.figma.com/design/VT79VSlhYlpl0g2JS9vLKt/Anatomy--IH-Design-System?node-id=35928-17750

### Guidance

The footer provides a consistent, branded closing for member experiences and centralizes legal links. It reinforces our promise (“Designed to treat you better.™”) and gives members clear access to required policies.

#### What it does

* Shows the **brand tagline** in a strong band at the bottom of the page.  
* Surfaces **site-wide legal links** (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Member Service Agreement).  
* Displays the **copyright line** for Included Health.

Use the footer on member-facing web pages where:

* the experience represents the broader Included Health product (not a narrow embedded widget), and  
* legal/brand framing is required at the bottom of the layout.

#### Anatomy

The footer has two stacked zones:

1. **Tagline bar (required)**  
   * Full-bleed horizontal bar.  
   * Background: `surface/brand/base`.  
   * Text: `text/primary light`.  
   * Centered line of copy:

     * `Designed to treat you better.™`  
2. **Legal area (required)**  
   * Background: `surface/neutral/weakest`.  
   * Center-aligned content for the **stacked** variant, or space-between alignment for the **inline** variant.  
   * Elements:  
     * **Link list**

       * `Terms of Service`  
       * `Privacy Policy`  
       * `Member Service Agreement`  
       * Each uses the standard **Link** styling.  
     * **Copyright line**

       * `© 20XX Included Health` (year kept up to date).

#### Layout variants

Use one of two layout variants depending on context and available width:

1. **Stacked (vertical)**  
   * Links stacked vertically, center-aligned with comfortable vertical spacing.  
   * Copyright appears on its own line below the links.  
   * Recommended for narrow viewports or simple layouts.  
2. **Inline (horizontal)**  
   * Links appear in a single row with consistent horizontal spacing.  
   * Copyright appears on the same row, right-aligned or at the far end.  
   * Recommended for wider/desktop layouts.

Both variants:

* Maintain consistent padding above/below the content.  
* Keep the tagline bar visually distinct from the legal area.

#### Behavior

* The footer sits at the **bottom of the page content** and scrolls with the page (not sticky).  
* Only one footer should appear per page/surface.  
* Links open in the same tab unless legal requirements dictate otherwise.

#### Content guidelines

* Tagline text is fixed: `Designed to treat you better.™`

  * Sentence case, includes the trademark symbol.  
* Legal links use exactly:  
  * `Terms of Service`  
  * `Privacy Policy`  
  * `Member Service Agreement`  
* Avoid additional marketing copy or CTAs; keep the footer focused on brand promise and legal content.

#### Accessibility

* Ensure sufficient color contrast between:  
  * tagline text and brand background, and  
  * links/text and the neutral background.  
* Links:  
  * are keyboard focusable in a logical order, and  
  * have accessible names matching their visible labels.  
* Do not rely on color alone to indicate link state; follow Link component guidance for focus/hover states.

### Guidance

Dot responses are the core message pattern for conversations between the member, Dot, and human Care Team members. This pattern ensures each sender has a distinct, consistent visual treatment so it’s always clear who is speaking.

**What it does**

- Displays messages from Dot, Care Team, and the member within a single thread.  
- Automatically chooses the correct visual treatment based on sender type.  
- Keeps sender identity and context clear across multi‑message exchanges.

**When and why to use**

- In all conversation threads that show Dot and/or Care Team messages.  
- Rendered automatically by the messaging system; not manually toggled per message.

**Use for**

- Any conversational view where Dot or Care Team messages appear.

# Patterns

## Forms

### Figma (Form \- Patterns)

https://www.figma.com/design/VT79VSlhYlpl0g2JS9vLKt/Anatomy--IH-Design-System?node-id=19445-142469

### Guidance

### Forms

Forms collect information from members so we can move care, coverage, and benefits workflows forward (for example, signing up, requesting a service, or performing a search). Good forms reduce cognitive and emotional load, make requirements obvious, and help members feel confident they’re doing the right thing.

#### Structure

- Prefer a single, vertical column for fields.  
- Group related fields logically and support them with short helper text where needed.  
- Place the primary action (Submit, Continue, Next) at the bottom.

#### Required and optional fields

- Mark all required field labels with an asterisk `*` at the end of the label.  
- Use an asterisk even when:  
  - all fields on the screen are required, or  
  - there is only one required field and it is the sole focus.  
- Do not:  
  - add “(Optional)” to labels, or  
  - show a legend like “Fields marked with \* are required.”  
- If a screen only contains optional questions, treat the screen as optional and provide a clear way to skip it.

#### Submit and alternative actions

- Keep the primary button enabled; do not disable it when fields are incomplete/invalid.  
- Use a single primary action:  
  - **Submit** – send data to system.  
  - **Continue** – move forward in linear flow.  
  - **Next / Back** – move between steps.  
- For optional screens, provide secondary actions like “Skip”, “Not now”.

#### Validation methods

Use **Validate on submit** by default, with Live/Guided validation when it clearly helps.

##### 1\. Validate on submit (default)

- Validate all fields on submit.  
- Show inline error messages by field.  
- If two+ fields have errors, also show a summary banner at top and move viewport so it’s visible.

##### 2\. Live validation

- Display an error when current input would result in error.  
- While editing: only for serious/non‑obvious errors; use sparingly.  
- After editing (on blur): show immediately if invalid.

##### 3\. Guided validation

- For complex requirements (passwords, character limits).  
- Show instructional text before or when field gains focus.  
- Do not show red error text until field has been unfocused at least once and input is invalid.

##### Text area with character limit

- Show `current / max` count below field.  
- While under limit: neutral styling.  
- Over limit: count and message in error style, with clear explanation.

#### Content guidelines for form actions

- **Continue / Cancel** – dual actions when only one way to move forward and cannot skip or go back.  
- **Next / Back** – dual actions for multi‑step flows.  
- **Enter** – preferred verb for inputting information (instead of “type”).  
- **Submit** – reserved for sending data to system.

## Empty states

### Figma (Empty States \- Patterns)

https://www.figma.com/design/VT79VSlhYlpl0g2JS9vLKt/Anatomy--IH-Design-System?node-id=35928-17750

### Guidance

Empty states clarify where content could exist, but currently does not. Unlike errors, empty states usually do not indicate a problem and can sometimes give the member a way to add or discover content.

#### Header

- Use second‑person POV when applicable (“You don’t have any lab results yet”), otherwise neutral.  
- Sentence case.  
- 3–7 words.  
- No punctuation unless a question.

#### Body copy

- Use second‑person POV when applicable.  
- Proper punctuation.  
- 1–2 sentences.  
- Explain why it’s empty and/or what will appear there in future.

#### CTA

- Neutral POV.  
- Sentence case, no punctuation.  
- 1–3 words.  
- Clearly describe the action (for example, “Upload document”).  
- Keep language consistent with header/body.

### Figma (Success States \- Patterns)

https://www.figma.com/design/VT79VSlhYlpl0g2JS9vLKt/Anatomy--IH-Design-System?node-id=35928-17750

### Guidance

Success states are discrete steps in a flow—usually longer or higher‑effort ones—where it’s crucial to clearly confirm a process has completed and what happens next.

#### Header

- Second‑person POV when applicable (“You’re all set”), otherwise neutral.  
- Sentence case.  
- 3–7 words.  
- Optional exclamation mark (used sparingly).

#### Body copy

- Second‑person POV when applicable.  
- Proper punctuation.  
- 1–2 sentences.  
- Reinforce what was completed and what the member can do next.

#### CTA

- Neutral POV.  
- Sentence case, no punctuation.  
- 1–3 words.  
- Clear and specific about the action (for example, “View details”, “Continue”).  
- Match header/body so the outcome is obvious.

## Error states

### Figma (Error States \- Patterns)

https://www.figma.com/design/VT79VSlhYlpl0g2JS9vLKt/Anatomy--IH-Design-System?node-id=35928-17750

### Guidance

Error states make problems visible, easy to understand, and helpful to recover from. They should clearly communicate what went wrong, what it means for the member, and the safest next step—without blame, panic, or jargon.

#### Error types

- **Field validation**  
  - Validate on submit: inline errors after primary action.  
  - Live validation: only when reliably helpful.  
- **Screen‑level banner**  
  - At top when multiple fields or whole submission have issues.  
- **Inline banner (card or modal)**  
  - Scoped to a specific container.  
- **Error screen**  
  - Full screen when the entire experience or key task is blocked.

#### Levels

- **Danger (red)** – severe errors requiring member action or representing destructive changes.  
- **Warning (yellow)** – precautions and critical instructions that help prevent errors.

#### What error messages should do

- Tell the member what happened.  
- Provide a solution if one exists, ideally a single clear action.  
- Be specific about ranges/values when relevant.  
- Be timely:  
  - Don’t interrupt while the member is fixing the issue.  
  - Don’t delay errors that would help them avoid mistakes.

#### Content guidelines

- **Do not accuse**  
  - Avoid blame; passive voice is acceptable if it reduces blame.  
- **Take accountability**  
  - Own system‑side errors (“Sorry, something went wrong on our end.”).  
- **Be clear**  
  - Avoid technical jargon and error codes.  
- **Be concise**  
  - Short, specific, meaningful.  
- **Be actionable**  
  - Provide a clear next step (“Add a weight”, not just “Weight can’t be blank.”).  
- **Be positive**  
  - Avoid harsh or negative language.  
- **Use sentence case**  
  - Avoid ALL CAPS.  
- **Avoid humor/fluff**  
  - No “oops”/“whoopsie” in clinical contexts.

## Do’s and Don’ts

#### Do’s

* **Design for emotional and cognitive safety.**  
  Reduce anxiety and effort, especially in clinical and financial flows. Make it obvious what’s happening, what’s expected of the member, and what happens next.  
* **Be clear by design.**  
  Use hierarchy, spacing, and structure so the right thing to do is visually obvious. Aim for one primary action per surface whenever possible.  
* **Keep AI and clinical care tightly grounded.**  
  Make Dot’s capabilities and limits explicit, and anchor guidance in credible clinical pathways. Use Dot to clarify and route, not to over-promise or replace clinicians.  
* **Use semantic tokens everywhere.**  
  Rely on surface/text/border semantic tokens (brand, neutral, success, warning, danger, overlay) instead of raw hex values or core palette tokens.  
* **Write plain, precise copy.**  
  Use sentence case, everyday language, and short sentences. Clearly label actions by outcome (for example, “See visit details”, “Upload document”) rather than mechanics (“Click here”).  
* **Optimize for accessibility by default.**  
  Maintain contrast, support keyboard and screen readers, and avoid using color alone for meaning. Treat dynamic content (new messages, errors, confirmations) as state changes that should be announced.  
* **Prefer familiar patterns over novelty.**  
  Use established components (cards, chips, badges, forms, messaging patterns) and extend them thoughtfully before inventing new patterns.  
* **Instrument key patterns.**  
  Emit impression and interaction events for structured patterns (quick replies, multi-select chips, cards, confirmations) with enough context to measure performance and safety.  
* **Fail safely and visibly.**  
  Use error patterns that explain what went wrong, what it means, and how to recover—owning system issues and guiding the member to the safest next step.

#### Don’ts

* **Don’t create generic or “bot-ish” healthcare UI.**  
  Avoid designs that feel like generic insurance dashboards, chatbots, or tech demos. The experience should feel distinctly Included Health and clinically grounded.  
* **Don’t overload screens or cards.**  
  Avoid dense walls of text, stacked CTAs, or mixed metaphors within the same surface. If everything looks important, nothing is.  
* **Don’t bypass semantic tokens.**  
  Don’t hard-code hex colors or use core palette tokens directly in mocks or implementation. Don’t invent one-off component colors instead of extending the semantic layer.  
* **Don’t rely on color, icon, or motion alone.**  
  Never make critical meaning depend only on color, an icon, or an animation. Always pair with clear text labels and accessible names.  
* **Don’t blame or confuse members in errors.**  
  Avoid accusatory language (“you did X wrong”), technical codes, vague “Something went wrong”, or dead-end errors without a next step.  
* **Don’t use playful or cutesy tone in clinical moments.**  
  Skip humor, emojis, and casual interjections (“oops”, “whoopsie”) in error messages, Dot disclaimers, visit flows, and serious health contexts.  
* **Don’t force a single rigid path when flexibility is safer.**  
  Avoid patterns that trap members in one way of responding (for example, only quick replies, no free text) when nuance or additional context might matter.  
* **Don’t invent new components lightly.**  
  Don’t design bespoke patterns where existing components (cards, forms, chips, messaging patterns, confirmation cards) can be adapted to the use case.  
* **Don’t hide real state changes.**  
  Don’t silently change or remove confirmations (for example, visits) when something fails downstream. Surface changes via explicit confirmation, error, or cancellation patterns.
